        <p class="card-text">One of the most popular bungee jumping in India is at Ozone Adventures in Bangalore. Bungee jumping being conducted by Ozone Adventures takes place from a height of about 80 feet above the ground. The only difference between bungee jumping in Bangalore and Rishikesh is that there is no fixed platform in Bangalore. The entire equipment for bungee jumping is fastened to a 130 ft high mobile crane. It might not be very safe jumping off a platform being held by a crane. People who belong to the age group of 18 and 60 years can enjoy this adrenaline-filled experience. Taking all the factors into consideration the safety of the jumper is given the utmost priority as bungee jumping from cranes is not as relatively safe as jumping from fixed platforms.
